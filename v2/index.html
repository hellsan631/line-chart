      <h2>Installation</h2>
      <p>We've chosen npm as our primary distribution system. The reason is simple: Bower forced us to version the build files, which was annoying when reviewing/merging pull requests. We don't like annoying things.</p>
      <p>The library is still in beta, which means it's not accessible through npm without specifying its version. Install it using the following command:</p>
      <p><code>$ npm install n3-charts@2.0.0-beta5 --save-dev</code></p>

      <h2>What's new ?</h2>
      <p>Good question. Not that we rebuilt this just because we like building things, right ? Seriously though, v2 right now is mostly about solving v1 problems, you know, extendability and maintenance. The chart's directive lifecycle has been thought of from the very beginning, which allows better transitions and full leverage of d3.js capabilities.</p>
      <p>Also, we now use something we call... Shoot, we dont have a name for that. Well, imagine a cake. With a bunch of fruits in it. Everything is baked in. Remove a fruit and there's a hole in the cake. No one wants a cake with air in it. That was v1. Now, imagine a pile of pancakes. Delicious, banana flavoured pancakes. Pour some maple syrup on those godly pastries. The syrup goes from one pancake to another, nothing fancy in this. Now if you remove one or two pancake, the syrup probably won't even notice. That's v2. v2's components are organized in layers and talk to each other using two powerful singletons, <span class="code">eventManager</span> and <span class="code">factoryManager</span>. It makes it super easy to add stuff and extend the directive's features.</p>
